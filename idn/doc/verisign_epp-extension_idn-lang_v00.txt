1.  Introduction

   This document describes an extension mapping for version 1.0 of the
   Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) [RFC5730].  This EPP extension
   mapping enables a client to specify the language tag (Section 2.1)
   for an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) registration.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented in order to develop a conforming
   implementation.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this protocol.

   "idnLang-1.0" is used as an abbreviation for
   "http://www.verisign.com/epp/idnLang-1.0".  The XML namespace prefix
   "idnLang" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.


2.  Object Attributes

   This extension adds additional elements to the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731].  Only those new elements are described here.

2.1.  Language Tag

   A valid language tag MUST be passed for all Internationalized Domain
   Name (IDN) registrations.  The valid langauge tag format is defined
   by the XML-Schema language element.  The set of valid langauge values
   is up to server policy.


3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in IDN registrations



Gould                                                           [Page 3]

   using a language tag (Section 2.1) via EPP.

3.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides three commands to retrieve object information: <check>
   to determine if an object is known to the server, <info> to retrieve
   detailed information associated with an object, and <transfer> to
   retrieve object transfer status information.

3.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <check> command
   or <check> response described in the EPP domain name mapping
   [RFC5731].

3.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <info> command or
   <info> response described in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731].

3.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <transfer>
   command or <transfer> response described in the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731].

3.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform objects: <create> to create
   an instance of an object, <delete> to delete an instance of an
   object, <renew> to extend the validity period of an object,
   <transfer> to manage object sponsorship changes, and <update> to
   change information associated with an object.

3.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <create>
   command described in EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731].

   The EPP <create> command provides a transform operation that allows a
   client to create a domain object.  In addition to the EPP command
   elements described in EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731], the command
   MUST contain the <extension> element.  The <extension> element MUST
   contain a child <idnLang:tag> element that contains the value of the
   language tag.

   Example <create> command with the IDN Language Tag extension:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:  <command>
   C:    <create>
   C:      <domain:create
   C:        xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
   C:        <domain:name>example.com</domain:name>
   C:        <domain:authInfo>
   C:          <domain:pw>2fooBAR</domain:pw>
   C:        </domain:authInfo>
   C:      </domain:create>
   C:    </create>
   C:    <extension>
   C:      <idnLang:tag
   C:        xmlns:idnLang=
   C:        "http://www.verisign.com/epp/idnLang-1.0">
   C:        ENG
   C:      </idnLang:tag>
   C:    </extension>
   C:    <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:  </command>
   C: </epp>

   When a <create> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <creData> element MUST contain child elements as described in EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731].

3.2.2.  EPP <delete> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <delete> command
   or <delete> response described in the EPP domain name mapping
   [RFC5731].

3.2.3.  EPP <renew> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <renew> command
   or <renew> response described in the EPP domain name mapping
   [RFC5731].

3.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <transfer>
   command or <transfer> response described in the EPP domain name
   mapping [RFC5731].





Gould                                                           [Page 5]

3.2.5.  EPP <update> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <update> command
   or <update> response described in the EPP domain name mapping
   [RFC5731].


4.  Formal Syntax

   One schema is presented here that is the EPP IDN Language Tag
   Extension schema.

   The formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation
   of the object mapping suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.  The BEGIN and END tags are not part of the schema; they
   are used to note the beginning and ending of the schema for URI
   registration purposes.

4.1.  IDN Language Tag Extension Schema

   BEGIN
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <schema targetNamespace="http://www.verisign.com/epp/idnLang-1.0"
     xmlns:idnLang="http://www.verisign.com/epp/idnLang-1.0"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"
     elementFormDefault="qualified">

     <annotation>
       <documentation>
         Extensible Provisioning Protocol v1.0 domain name
         extension schema for IDN Lang Tag.
       </documentation>
     </annotation>

     <!--
       Child elements found in EPP commands.

   <!-- End of schema. -->
   </schema>
   END

       Extension, version 1.1.


6.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [RFC5730] and
   protocol layers used by EPP.  The security considerations described
   in these other specifications apply to this specification as well.
